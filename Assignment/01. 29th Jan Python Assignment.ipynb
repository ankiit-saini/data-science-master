    "#14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "#Answer-\n",
    "# Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager, which includes a built-in garbage collector.\n",
    "# Here are the key aspects of memory management in Python:\n",
    "# 1. Automatic Memory Management: Python automatically allocates and deallocates memory for objects\n",
    "#    as needed. Developers do not need to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "# 2. Reference Counting: Python uses reference counting to keep track of the number of references\n",
    "#    to an object. When the reference count drops to zero (i.e., no references to the object exist),\n",
    "#    the memory occupied by that object is deallocated.\n",
    "# 3. Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python has a garbage collector that\n",
    "#    periodically checks for and collects objects that are no longer reachable or referenced.\n",
    "#    This helps to clean up circular references that reference counting alone cannot handle.\n",
    "# 4. Memory Pools: Python uses memory pools to manage small objects efficiently. It allocates memory in blocks for small objects to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.\n",
    "# 5. Memory Leaks: While Python's memory management is generally effective, memory leaks can still occur if references to objects\n",
    "#    are not properly released. Developers should be mindful of circular references and ensure that objects are dereferenced when they are no longer needed.\n",
    "# 6. Memory Profiling: Python provides tools like `gc` (garbage collector) and `tracemalloc` to help developers monitor memory usage and identify memory leaks in their applications.\n",
    "# 7. Custom Memory Management: In some cases, developers may need to implement custom memory management strategies,\n",
    "#    especially when dealing with large data structures or performance-critical applications.\n",
    "#    This can be done using Python's `ctypes` or `          cffi` libraries to interface with C memory management functions."
